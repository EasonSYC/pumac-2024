We aim to construct an IFS in \(\R^k\) where \(k = \ceil{\frac{m}{n}}\), and will be concerning the open set condition with the open unit cube \((0, 1)^k \subset \R^k\).

We let the contraction ratio be \(c = 2^{-n}\), and we let the number of contractions be \(p = 2^m\). Now, if there exists an IFS such that the OSC is satisfied, we will have the dimension \(s\) satisfies that
\[
p \cdot c^s = 1 \iff 2^m \cdot \left(2^{-n}\right)^s = 1 \iff 2^{m-ns} = 1 \iff s = \frac{m}{n}.
\]

Now the task remaining is to find some IFS that satisfies the OSC. But this is straightforward: for each contraction in the IFS, we first apply \(x \mapsto 2^{-n}x\) to the input, which means the unit cube \((0, 1)^k\) will be mapped to \(\left(0, 2^{-n}\right)^k\).

It is well-known that one could place \((2^n)^k = 2^{nk}\) cubes of size congruent to \(\left(0, 2^{-n}\right)^k\) in the unit cube \((0, 1)^k\) without overlapping, simply by splitting the unit cube into small cubes with side length \(2^{-n}\). Each side will be divided into \(2^n\) pieces, which gives the result number of cubes \(2^{nk}\) as we desired. We only have \(2^m\) contractions, and since we have \(k = \ceil{\frac{m}{n}} \geq \frac{m}{n}\), this means \(m \leq nk\) and therefore the placement of \(2^m\) contractions is possible in this case, such that the image \((0, 1)^k\) of any two contractions do not overlap, and is still a subset of \((0, 1)^k\).

Therefore for some IFS, \((0, 1)^k\) satisfies the OSC with the desired number of contractions and contraction ratio. meaning the dimension of the IFS can take any rational number. And since every IFS has an attractor \(E \subset \R^n\), we know that there must exist some set \(E \subset \R^n\) that has a Hausdorff dimension of \(\frac{m}{n}\).

But since postive rational numbers \(\Q_+\) is dense in positive real numbers \(\R_+\), we can now conclude that the Hausdorff dimension can be arbitrarily close to any positive real number \(r > 0, r \in \R\).
