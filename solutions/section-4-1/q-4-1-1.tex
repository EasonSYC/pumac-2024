Consider the open set \(U = (0,1) \times \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).\)

We have
\begin{align*}
    f_1(U) &= \left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right),\\
    f_2(U) &= \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right) \times \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right),\\
    f_3(U) &= \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).
\end{align*}

It is not difficult to see that \(f_1(U) \cap f_2(U) = f_1(U) \cap f_3(U) = f_2(U) \cap f_3(U) = \emptyset\) due to obviously separated \(x\) or \(y\) intervals, and they are all contained within \(U\). So this \(U\) is an open set, and this IFS satisfies the open set condition.

Notice that \(f_1, f_2, f_3\) all have contraction ratio \(c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = \frac{1}{2}\) as shown in the definition. Solving
\[
\sum_{i = 1}^{3} \frac{1}{2^s} = 1 \iff 3 = 2^s \iff s = \frac{\log 3}{\log 2},
\]
which means the Hausdorff dimension of this IFS's attractor is \(\frac{\log 3}{\log 2}\).
