To show that $f(K)$ is compact given $f$ is a contraction and $K$ is compact, we show that $f(K)$ is closed and bounded.

\begin{itemize}
\item $f(K)$ is bounded: since $K$ is bounded, there exists some $r > 0$ s.t. $K \subset B_{(0, \ldots, 0)} (r)$. In other words, for all $x \in K$, $|x| < r$ .
    
    Since $f$ is a contraction, set $y = 0$, we will see that $|f(x)| = c|x| < cr$. Therefore, $f(K) \subset B_{(0, \ldots, 0)} (cr)$, which shows $f(K)$ is bounded.
\item $f(K)$ is closed: since $K$ is closed, $\bar{K}$ is open.
\end{itemize}
