Consider the following \(2^{n - 1}\) contractions each with contraction ration \(2^{-n}\) forming an IFS for some \(n \in N, n \geq 2\):
\begin{align*}
    (f_n)_1 (x) &= \frac{1}{2^n}(x),\\
    (f_n)_2 (x) &= \frac{1}{2^n}(x) + \frac{1}{2^n},\\
    (f_n)_3 (x) &= \frac{1}{2^n}(x) + \frac{2}{2^n},\\
    \vdots &= \vdots\\
    (f_n)_{2^{n-1}}(x) &= \frac{1}{2^n}(x) + \frac{2^{n-1} - 1}{2^n}.
\end{align*}

This satisfies the open set condition for \(U = (0, 1)\), since
\begin{align*}
    (f_n)_1 (U) &= \left(0, \frac{1}{2^n}\right),\\
    (f_n)_2 (U) &= \left(\frac{1}{2^n}, \frac{2}{2^n}\right),\\
    (f_n)_3 (U) &= \left(\frac{2}{2^n}, \frac{3}{2^n}\right),\\
    \vdots &= \vdots\\
    (f_n)_{2^{n-1}}(U) &= \left( \frac{2^{n-1} - 1}{2^n}, \frac{2^{n-1}}{2^n}\right),
\end{align*}
which are obviously pairwise disjoint and all subsets of \(U\).

Let its attractor be \(E_n\). We will see that its dimension \(s_n\) satisfies that
\[
2^{n - 1} \cdot \left(2^{-n}\right)^s = 1 \iff 2^{n - 1 - sn} = 1 \iff s = \frac{n - 1}{n}.
\]

Now, consider the set
\[
E = \bigcup_{i = 2}^{n} E_n \subset \R
\]

Since \(E \subset \R = \R^1\), we know the Hausdorff dimension of \(E \leq 1\).

Consider \(\h^1(E)\). By the countable sub-additivity property of a measure, we can see
\begin{align*}
\h^1(E) &= \h^1 \left(\bigcup_{i = 2}^{+\infty} E_n\right)\\
&\leq \sum_{i = 2}^{+\infty} \h^1(E_n).
\end{align*}

But since each \(E_n\) has a Hausdorff dimension of \(\frac{n - 1}{n} < 1\), by problem 2.1.7 we must have \(\h^1(E_n) = 0\).

Therefore, \(\h^1(E) = 0\), which shows the Hausdorff dimension of \(E\) must be \(\geq\) 1.

This shows that \(E\) has Hausdorff dimension 1 but have \(\h^1(E) = 0\).
