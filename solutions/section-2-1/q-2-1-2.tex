None of them are \(\delta\)-covers.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\frac{1}{3}\) isn't in any of the intervals, but it's in \([0,1]\), and we want \([0,1] \subset \bigcap_i U_i\).
    \item We want \(|U_i| < \delta = \frac{1}{2}\) for all \(i\), but \(U_1 = [0,\frac{1}{1}] = [0,1]\), and
    \[|[0,1]| = \sup_{x,y \in [0,1]} |y-x| \geq |1-0| = 1 > \frac{1}{2}.\]
    \item We want \(|U_i| < \delta = \frac{1}{2}\) for all \(i\), but
    \[|[0,\frac{1}{2}]| = \sup_{x,y \in [0,\frac{1}{2}]} |y-x| \geq \left|\frac{1}{2} - 0\right| = \frac{1}{2} = \delta\]
    so it's invalid.
\end{enumerate}
